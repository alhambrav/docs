==================
What is CrafterCMS
==================

CrafterCMS is a modern content management platform for building digital experience applications including:

* Single Page Applications (SPAs) using frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular
* Native mobile apps and headless applications (IOT, digital signage, wearables, etc.)
* HTML5 websites using Bootstrap or other HTML frameworks
* e-commerce front-ends
* OTT video experiences on AWS Elemental Media Services
* AR/VR applications using A-Frame

Crafter is a dynamic CMS based on Git and supports DevContentOps processes for code and content. It is also a hybrid-headless, API-first (GraphQL, REST, in-process) CMS, and that allows developers to use their favorite UI frameworks and tools.

CrafterCMS differentiates itself from existing CMSs with its architecture: microservices-based, serverless, elastic and planet-wide scalability. To learn more, see the :ref:`general-architecture`.
